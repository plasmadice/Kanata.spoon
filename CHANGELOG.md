# Changelog

All notable changes to Kanata.spoon will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.2] - 2025-10-14

### Added
- **Health Check API**: New port-based health checking system
  - Added `port` variable for configuring Kanata API port (e.g., `kanata -p 10000`)
  - Uses JSON API to verify Kanata is running and healthy, not just the process
  - Sends `{"RequestCurrentLayerName":{}}` and validates response
  - Falls back to process-based detection when port not configured
  - More reliable than checking process list alone

### Changed
- **Menu Bar**: Simplified menu options
  - Removed "Monitoring Inputs..." and "Start Monitoring" options to reduce redundancy
  - "Start/Stop Service" controls both Kanata service and monitoring
- **Health Detection**: Improved Kanata service detection logic
  - When port is configured, uses API health check instead of process detection
  - Better reliability for determining if Kanata is actually responding
- **Logging**: Enhanced device detection logging
  - Added detailed logging for device additions and removals
  - Shows which devices are included/excluded by config sections
  - Logs when service is restarted while already running
- **Menu Bar Animation**: Added restart animation
  - Shows üîÑ/‚è≥/‚ö° animation when Kanata is restarting
  - Visual feedback for device detection and service restarts
  - Fixed tooltip method error in animation function
- **Device Reconnection Detection**: Enhanced device tracking
  - Added specific "Device reconnected" logging for devices that were recently removed
  - Tracks recently removed devices for 30 seconds to detect reconnections
  - Added debug logging to help troubleshoot device detection issues
- **Logging Cleanup**: Simplified log messages
  - Removed redundant "*** DEVICE(S) REMOVED/ADDED ***" messages
  - Removed "Showing restart animation" message
  - Rely on detailed filtering info messages instead
- **Auto-start Fix**: Fixed port-based health check conflict
  - Auto-start now uses process-based detection instead of health check API
  - Prevents chicken-and-egg problem when port is configured
  - Service will start automatically even when port-based health check is enabled

## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-14

### Fixed
- **Kanata Detection**: Fixed issue where Kanata binary couldn't be found at startup
  - Now checks common installation paths (`/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `~/.cargo/bin`, etc.)
  - No longer relies solely on PATH environment variable
  - Caches binary path for better performance
  - GUI applications on macOS don't always inherit terminal PATH, this fix resolves that

### Changed
- **Menu Bar Icons**: 
  - üîé icon now shows when monitoring is active but Kanata service is not running
  - ‚å®Ô∏è icon shows when both monitoring and Kanata service are running
  - üòµÔ∏è icon shows when monitoring is inactive
- **Menu Controls**: 
  - Renamed "Monitoring..." to "Monitoring Inputs..." for clarity
  - "Monitoring Inputs..." button now only stops monitoring (not the Kanata service)
  - Improved menu item descriptions and tooltips
